ðŸ“˜ Repository Description
A Rigorous Formulation of the Twistor-Structural Quantum Vacuum Theory (TSQVT) This repository contains the LaTeX source, analytical derivations, and exclusion plots for a theoretical framework in which particle mass emerges from a noncommutative twistor vacuum. The project includes:

A self-adjoint SchrÃ¶dinger Hamiltonian with position-dependent mass

Perturbative energy shift calculations for hydrogen atom states

Spectroscopic constraints and falsifiability analysis

TikZ-based exclusion plots and symbolic derivations

Developed by Mohamed Makraini, Independent Researcher (MÃ¡laga, Spain). 

For theoretical physics, quantum geometry, and precision spectroscopy.
